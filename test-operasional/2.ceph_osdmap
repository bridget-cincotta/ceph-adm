1. Create pool

ceph osd pool create osdmap-pool 128

ceph osd lspools

ceph osd pool get osdmap-pool pg_num

2. By default ceph max object size is limited to 128MiB
sudo ceph config set global osd_max_object_size 600M/1G

3. Put object

rados -p osdmap-pool put <object_name> <name_file>

4. Show where object are stored in OSDs

ceph osd map <pool_name> <object_name>

5. How to read

osdmap e1805 pool 'osdmap-pool' (5) object 'bigobject' -> pg 5.f71d4b98 (5.18) -> up ([2,5,1], p2) acting ([2,5,1], p2)

- osdmap e1805 = Version of map
- 'osdmap-pool' =  name of the pool
- (5) = id of pool
- pg 5.f71d4b98 = PGs ID which object belongs to
- up ([2,5,1], p2) acting ([2,5,1], p2) = if you see 3 number (2,5,1) it means your pool is set 3 replication, which means every object has copy in 3 different osd, and you see p2 it means, the primary object is exist on osd.2
